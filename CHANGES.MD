Originally I got an incomplete because I didn't add my github link. So I added that.
Also, I realized my error message was different so I changed that.
One of the tests didn't work so I removed an if statement.

12/7... second redo...
Firstly, I had an issue in my BFRegister where I was adding to my ArrayList.
I was adding, but I wasn't checking if what I was adding was in the ArrayList already.
I changed what BigFraction was held in BFCalculator to 0/1.
BigFraction had issues with simplify and toString. I didn't realize
BigInteger had a gcd() method.
